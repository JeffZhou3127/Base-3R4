# Base 3R4
In this project, we intend to present our design intuitively and ensure easy understanding and professional presentation of the plan. This project was put together to solve the obstacle of waste management on the Red Planet, 220 million miles away. Because our team realized that leaving behind waste on Mars is detrimental to Marsâ€™ environment, future scientific studies, and potential Martian biolife, we propose a three-part plan described on this website, which was created to provide an interactive experience to further increase understanding and potential for real-life applications.

## Features
In this website, we intend to create a web page with easy navigation and a smooth front-end finish. Because of this, the navigation bar that is essential to this website has been created. Additionally, excessive front-end development ensured that the user experience was satisfactory, with easy traveling between pages. Cards that can be clicked and browsed allow users to interact with our plan and show our solutions.
Additionally, graphics and colors are closely matched, creating visual consistency that is essential to the front-end of the website. A Blender render of Mars and a photograph of the Jezero Crater exist within the webpage. 
Finally, the website is designed to fit within different monitors of different sizes. This means whether the user is on their phone, laptop, or a 4K monitor, they have an optimized website experience.

## How to Use
To access the webpage, simply click the link provided. After that, the website will load immediately. To navigate around the website, be sure to click the links provided on the navigation bar for easy browsing on the website. To see our solution to each objective, click each card, and the solutions will be revealed on a separate page.

## Technologies
Our team used a series of different languages and libraries to make the creation of the website possible. They include:
* __HTML:__ The foundational markup language used for creating websites and structuring content
* __CSS:__ A style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language like HTML
* __JavaScript:__ Mainly used to add interactivity to web pages within the user's browser
* __React.js:__ An open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces
* __Redux.js:__ A JavaScript library primarily used for managing and centralizing application state
* __Git:__ An open-source distributed version control system
* __GitHub:__ A cloud-based platform built on the Git version control system that allows developers to store, manage, and share code and other project files
* __VSCode:__ Used for a variety of programming tasks and supports a vast range of programming languages through its extension ecosystem

## Collaborators
We were split into two teams:
1. Our coding and web developer team, Jeffery Zhou and Stephen Li, are responsible for the coding, front-end development, and styling to create this website.
2. Our presentation and web content team, Samuel and Ada Lin, are responsible for how our project information is presented, meaning informational text in the website, videos, and even this README!
