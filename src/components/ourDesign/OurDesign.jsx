        As a solution to the obstacle of space exploration, the difficulty of where inorganic waste produced by
        astronauts should go, we propose a system consisting of three parts. Composed of both leading-age technology and
        pre-launch logistics, our system aims to solve the inevitable problem of waste management on a planet
        220 million miles away.
