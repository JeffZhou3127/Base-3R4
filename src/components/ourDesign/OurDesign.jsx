      <p>
        As a solution to the obstacle of space exploration, the difficulty of where inorganic waste produced by
        astronauts should go, we propose a system consisting of three parts. Composed of both leading-age technology and
        pre-launch logistics, our system aims to solve the inevitable problem of waste management on a planet
        220 million miles away.

          <p>
            Aluminum structures and the 3-dimensional structure used to inflate Martian habitats are difficult to recycle and
            reuse in their current form without melting, which is unfeasible on Mars because of its lack of oxygen.

          <h3>Problem 2: <span>Cosmic Celebrations</span></h3>
          <p>
            Plastics like Ethylene-Vinyl Acetate (EVA) waste and Polymer Matrix Composites are difficult to break up and recycle
            because of their robust and reinforced molecular crosslinked systems.

          <p>
            Pure carbon from oxygen separation projects may not seem to amount to anything useful.
            We donâ€™t have the capability to transport such advanced technology to space to produce graphite from carbon.
